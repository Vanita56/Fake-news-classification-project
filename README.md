# Fake-news-classification-project
In this project I build two models to evaluate the performance of our project. SVM has more Accuracy score than logistic regression.
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a given news article is fake or genuine.
Dataset: news articals as real and fake.
